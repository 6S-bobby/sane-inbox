Unanswered questions will probably be important
- How much context is needed to respond? How many api calls are there? Will api costs be too high?
- How to determine where to activate this (for example, when we expand to slack, in amazon's slack there are some channels mostly q&a or benefits or it help with thousands of people, it shouldn't be activated anywhere)
- Can we invade messenger with this crutch? Slack and email I'm pretty sure is possible, but it may be harder in messenger? I'm not sure - possibly it's universally possible as a plug-in in browser, but what about the apps on the phone? If the intervention can't affect the apps on the phone (which a large amount of people use, e.g. slack, messenger, and apple mail, etc), this may be a major problem.
